Email Header Analysis Report
============================

Objective:
----------
Analyze the technical email header to identify potential phishing or spoofing indicators.

Authentication Summary:
------------------------
- DMARC: ✅ Compliant
  (Domain policy is properly enforced, helps in preventing spoofing.)
- SPF Alignment: ✅ Passed
  (Sender used authorized mail server.)
- SPF Authenticated: ✅ Passed
- DKIM Alignment: ✅ Passed
- DKIM Authenticated: ❌ Failed
  (The message's DKIM signature could not be verified. This might indicate tampering or a misconfiguration.)

Relay & Server Path:
---------------------
Received Delay: 1 second (Normal)

Mail Hops:
----------
1. From: NzA3NzUyMg | Server: geopod-ismtpd-28 | Status: OK
2. From: Unknown     | Server: recvd-586fc64576-dz729 | Status: OK
3. From: o1.ptr2949.theforage.com (IP: 149.72.193.37) | Status: ⚠️ Blacklisted
4. To: mx.google.com via 2002:a05:7208:4047:b0:a2:afec:4997 | Status: OK

Observations:
-------------
- DKIM failure indicates potential message tampering or configuration error.
- One server in the path (149.72.193.37) is on a blacklist — this raises a red flag.
- SPF and DMARC are both passing, which adds partial legitimacy.
- Overall, the email is partially suspicious and should be treated with caution.

Conclusion:
-----------
Even though SPF and DMARC passed, the DKIM failure and presence of a blacklisted server IP make this email **potentially suspicious**. Further investigation is recommended before trusting the content or clicking any links.
